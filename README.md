I am a CS Major of the University of Texas at Dallas specializing into using Machine Learning on the Edge to create smart home devices capable of disconnecting from the cloud once trained with the proper dataset. It's just a dream for now as I learn the prequisite skills, so for now, I hope I can have a falshy website or mod on here.
